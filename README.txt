What this script does:
------------------------------
This script creates a folder called "Games" in your user directory and changes
it's icon to be thematically similar to the other Windows 11 known folders (Documents,
Pictures, Downloads, etc.)

Why it does this and what it's for?:
------------------------------
What I personally use this folder for is to put shortcuts of games into it. Usually
games without launchers, emulators, etc. That way I don't have to dig through directories
for it and I don't have to clutter my desktop up with icons. The icon just makes it look
more uniform.
